# Tip-Tax-and-Total
Design a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. 

The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, and then calculate the amount of a 15 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax.  Display each of these amounts and total. 

Pay attention to the Grading Criteria, particularly CONSTANTS and label closing curly brackets.
