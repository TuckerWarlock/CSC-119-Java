# Prime Numbers List
Display all of the prime numbers from 1 through 100.  The program should have a loop that calls the isPrime() function. 
> Design a Boolean function named isPrime(), which takes an integer as an argument and returns True if the argument is a prime number, or False otherwise. 

* A prime number is a number that is only evenly divided by itself and 1
* For example, the number 5 is a prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5
* The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6

###### Use CONSTANTS to set the maximum number in the table to 100 and the number of entries per row to 5.
