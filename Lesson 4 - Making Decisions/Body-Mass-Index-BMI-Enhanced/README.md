# Body-Mass-Index-BMI-Enhancement

Design a modular program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index (BMI).  The BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height.  A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:

###### Enhance the BMI program from the last lesson, so that it displays a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight.  A sedentary person's weight is considered to be optimal if their BMI is between 18.5 and 25.  If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered underweight.  If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.
