# Change for a Dollar Game

Design a change-counting game that gets the user to enter the number of coins required to make exactly one dollar.  The program should ask the user to enter the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.  If the total value of the coins entered is equal to one dollar, the program should congratulate the user for winning the game.  Otherwise, the program should display a message indicating whether the amount entered was more than or less than one dollar. 

### example output:
