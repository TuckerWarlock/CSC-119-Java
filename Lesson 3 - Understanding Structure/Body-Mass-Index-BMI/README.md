# Body-Mass-Index-BMI

Design a modular program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index (BMI).  The BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height.  A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:

## BMI = Weight X 703/Height X Height

*example output:*
* Enter a weight in lbs.
* 175
* Enter a height in inches.
* 69
* Body Mass Index: 25.84015963032976

### An approach:
(INPUT) Call a module to get the weight and height from the user. 
(PROCESS) Pass weight and height to a module that calculates BMI. 
(OUTPUT) Display the BMI in the calling module (main()?).
