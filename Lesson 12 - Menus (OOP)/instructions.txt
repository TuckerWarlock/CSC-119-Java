Geometry Calculator  (15 points)
Write a program that displays the following menu:

   Geometry Calculator

1. Calculate the area of a Circle

2. Calculate the area of a Rectangle

3. Calculate the area of a Triangle

4. End the program.

Enter your selection:

If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display the area.  Use the following formula to calculate the circle’s area.

area = PI * r * r

Use 3.14159 for PI and the radius of the circle for r.

If the user enters 2, the program should ask for the length and width of the rectangle, and then display the rectangle’s area.  Use the following formula to calculate the rectangle’s area:

area = length * width

If the user enters 3, the program should ask for the length of the triangle’s base and its height, and then display its area.  Use the following formula to calculate the area of the triangle:

area = base * height * 0.5

If the user enters 4, the program should end.
